    "## 1. Loading the NIPS papers\n",
    "<p>The NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/project_158/img/nips_logo.png\" alt=\"The logo of NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)\"></p>\n",
    "<p>First, we will explore the CSV file to determine what type of data we can use for the analysis and how it is structured. A research paper typically consists of a title, an abstract and the main text. Other data such as figures and tables were not extracted from the PDF files. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. In this analysis, we will focus on analyzing these papers with natural language processing methods.</p>"

    "## 6.  Prepare the text for LDA analysis\n",
    "<p>The main text analysis method that we will use is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is able to perform topic detection on large document sets, determining what the main 'topics' are in a large unlabeled set of texts. A 'topic' is a collection of words that tend to co-occur often. The hypothesis is that LDA might be able to clarify what the different topics in the research titles are. These topics can then be used as a starting point for further analysis.</p>\n",
    "<p>LDA does not work directly on text data. First, it is necessary to convert the documents into a simple vector representation. This representation will then be used by LDA to determine the topics. Each entry of a 'document vector' will correspond with the number of times a word occurred in the document. In conclusion, we will convert a list of titles into a list of vectors, all with length equal to the vocabulary. For example, <em>'Analyzing machine learning trends with neural networks.'</em> would be transformed into <code>[1, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0]</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>We'll then plot the 10 most common words based on the outcome of this operation (the list of document vectors). As a check, these words should also occur in the word cloud.</p>"

Typically, one would calculate the 'perplexity' metric to determine which number of topics is best and iterate over different amounts of topics until the lowest 'perplexity' is found. For now, let's play around with a different number of topics. From there, we can distinguish what each topic is about ('neural networks', 'reinforcement learning', 'kernel methods', 'gaussian processes', etc.).</p>"
